# playlist.js
Alt playlist app using JS libraries and node backend.

Objective of the application is to learn/practise:
* By comparing development using rails framework (playlist.rb) and javascript stack. 
* Ecma 6 (used only on frontend)
* Coffeescript (node server)
* browserify
* Front end JS libraries (rather than framework such as Angular): ractive (data binding), parsley (form validation), crossroads (routing), axios (http) etc
* New backend JS libraries such as Istanbul and Socket.io
